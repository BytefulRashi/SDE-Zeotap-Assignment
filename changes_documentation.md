# Detailed Documentation of Changes Made

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of all changes made to implement the Wrangler enhancements for byte size and time duration units parsers, as well as the AggregateStats directive.

## Files Created and Modified

### Grammar Modifications

**File:** `/home/ubuntu/wrangler/wrangler-core/src/main/antlr4/io/cdap/wrangler/parser/Directives.g4`
**Changes:** Added lexer rules for BYTE_SIZE and TIME_DURATION tokens and modified parser rules to accept these tokens.

**Key Additions:**
- Added lexer rule for BYTE_SIZE: `BYTE_SIZE : NUMBER BYTE_UNIT ;`
- Added lexer rule for TIME_DURATION: `TIME_DURATION : NUMBER TIME_UNIT ;`
- Added fragment for BYTE_UNIT: `fragment BYTE_UNIT : [Bb] | [Kk][Bb] | [Mm][Bb] | [Gg][Bb] | [Tt][Bb] ;`
- Added fragment for TIME_UNIT: `fragment TIME_UNIT : [Nn][Ss] | [Uu][Ss] | [Mm][Ss] | [Ss] | [Mm] | [Hh] | [Dd] ;`
- Added parser rules for byteSizeArg and timeDurationArg
- Modified argument rule to include byteSizeArg and timeDurationArg

**Explanation:**
These changes extend the grammar to recognize byte size values (like "10MB") and time duration values (like "500ms") as distinct token types. The fragments define the supported units for each type, and the parser rules allow these tokens to be used as arguments in directives.

### API Updates

**File:** `/home/ubuntu/wrangler/wrangler-api/src/main/java/io/cdap/wrangler/api/parser/TokenType.java`
**Changes:** Added BYTE_SIZE and TIME_DURATION to the token types enum.

**Key Additions:**
```java
BYTE_SIZE("byte size"),
TIME_DURATION("time duration"),
```

**Explanation:**
This update adds the new token types to the TokenType enum, which is used throughout the system to identify different types of tokens in the parser.

**File:** `/home/ubuntu/wrangler/wrangler-api/src/main/java/io/cdap/wrangler/api/parser/ByteSize.java` (New file)
**Key Implementation:**
- Extends Token class
- Parses byte size values with units (B, KB, MB, GB, TB)
- Provides methods to get the value in different units
- Handles unit conversions
- Implements proper error handling for invalid formats

**Explanation:**
This class represents a byte size value with its unit. It parses the input string, extracts the numeric value and unit, and provides methods to convert between different units. It also includes validation to ensure the input format is correct.

**File:** `/home/ubuntu/wrangler/wrangler-api/src/main/java/io/cdap/wrangler/api/parser/TimeDuration.java` (New file)
**Key Implementation:**
- Extends Token class
- Parses time duration values with units (ns, us, ms, s, m, h, d)
- Provides methods to get the value in different units
- Handles unit conversions
- Implements proper error handling for invalid formats

**Explanation:**
This class represents a time duration value with its unit. It parses the input string, extracts the numeric value and unit, and provides methods to convert between different units. It also includes validation to ensure the input format is correct.

**File:** `/home/ubuntu/wrangler/wrangler-api/src/main/java/io/cdap/wrangler/api/parser/UsageDefinition.java`
**Changes:** Updated to support the new token types in directive definitions.

**Key Additions:**
- Added support for BYTE_SIZE and TIME_DURATION token types in the define method
- Updated token type handling in the usage generation

**Explanation:**
These changes allow directives to define arguments of type BYTE_SIZE and TIME_DURATION, which is necessary for implementing directives that use these new token types.

### Core Parser Updates

**File:** `/home/ubuntu/wrangler/wrangler-core/src/main/java/io/cdap/wrangler/parser/RecipeVisitor.java`
**Changes:** Added visitor methods for the new token types.

**Key Additions:**
```java
@Override
public RecipeSymbol.Builder visitByteSizeArg(DirectivesParser.ByteSizeArgContext ctx) {
  builder.addToken(new ByteSize(ctx.BYTE_SIZE().getText()));
  return builder;
}

@Override
public RecipeSymbol.Builder visitTimeDurationArg(DirectivesParser.TimeDurationArgContext ctx) {
  builder.addToken(new TimeDuration(ctx.TIME_DURATION().getText()));
  return builder;
}
```

**Explanation:**
These visitor methods are called when the parser encounters BYTE_SIZE and TIME_DURATION tokens in the input. They create the appropriate token objects and add them to the token group being built.

### New Directive Implementation

**File:** `/home/ubuntu/wrangler/wrangler-core/src/main/java/io/cdap/wrangler/steps/AggregateStats.java` (New file)
**Key Implementation:**
- Implements the Directive interface
- Defines usage with byteSizeColumn, timeDurationColumn, totalSizeColumn, totalTimeColumn, and optional parameters
- Initializes with source and target column names, output units, and aggregation type
- Implements execution logic to aggregate byte sizes and time durations
- Handles unit conversions for the output
- Supports both total and average aggregation types
- Uses the TransientStore for maintaining state across records

**Explanation:**
This directive aggregates byte size and time duration values across multiple records. It can calculate totals or averages and convert the results to specified output units. It uses the TransientStore to maintain state across records, which allows it to process records in batches.

### Unit Tests

**File:** `/home/ubuntu/wrangler/wrangler-api/src/test/java/io/cdap/wrangler/api/parser/ByteSizeTest.java` (New file)
**Key Tests:**
- Tests for valid byte sizes with different units
- Tests for case-insensitive units
- Tests for zero values
- Tests for unit conversions
- Tests for invalid formats
- Tests for toString and toJson methods

**Explanation:**
These tests verify that the ByteSize class correctly parses and handles byte size values with different units, performs proper unit conversions, and handles error cases appropriately.

**File:** `/home/ubuntu/wrangler/wrangler-api/src/test/java/io/cdap/wrangler/api/parser/TimeDurationTest.java` (New file)
**Key Tests:**
- Tests for valid time durations with different units
- Tests for case-insensitive units
- Tests for zero values
- Tests for unit conversions
- Tests for invalid formats
- Tests for toString and toJson methods

**Explanation:**
These tests verify that the TimeDuration class correctly parses and handles time duration values with different units, performs proper unit conversions, and handles error cases appropriately.

**Key Tests:**
- Tests for parsing byte size tokens in directives
- Tests for parsing time duration tokens in directives
- Tests for parsing the AggregateStats directive
- Tests for mixed token types
- Tests for case-insensitive units

**Explanation:**
These tests verify that the parser correctly recognizes and processes byte size and time duration tokens in directives, and that the AggregateStats directive can be parsed correctly.

**File:** `/home/ubuntu/wrangler/wrangler-core/src/test/java/io/cdap/wrangler/steps/AggregateStatsTest.java` (New file)
**Key Tests:**
- Tests for usage definition
- Tests for initialization with different parameters
- Tests for invalid unit and aggregation type validation
- Tests for total aggregation
- Tests for average aggregation
- Tests for handling null values
- Tests for handling string values
